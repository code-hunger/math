# Bang-Bang principle

A project I did for a course in Functional Analysis in spring, 2021/2022.

It is based on the following books:
* "Geometric Functional Analysis and its Applications" by Richard B. Holmes, for the first theorem proved;
* "Functional analysis and time optimal control" by Hermes, for the second theorem proved.

The proofs use the [ Lyapunov's theorem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_measure#Lyapunov's_theorem) for convexity of the range of vector-valued measures and the [Kreinâ€“Milman theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krein%E2%80%93Milman_theorem) for existence of an extreme point of a convex compact.

I made an English translation in [Bang-Bang-EN.pdf](BangBang-EN.pdf).
