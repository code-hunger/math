# Classification theorem for finitely-generated modules over PID

A project I did for a seminar I did in Abstract Algebra in Fall, 2020/2021.

In our main Algebra courses we have not had covered modules, so in this report I did an extensive introduction to the topic, assuming only linear algebra and basic group/ring theory knowledge.

It is my first body of longer mathematical text and it is written in more talkative style. 
I try to keep the English translation as close as possible to the original vibe. 

You will notice I also did some play with asymptote graphics. I find now some of them unnecessarily complicated (looking at [aligned_proof_second.pdf](aligned_proof_second.asy)), but I probably won't invest in simplifying them now.

Unlike my other two bachelor projects in the Bang-Bang principle and Function Extensions that I translated manually,
here I committed a ChatGPT-assisted English translation in [modules_and_abelian_classification_EN.tex](modules_and_abelian_classification_EN_DRAFT_TRANSLATION.tex) that follows the Bulgarian original almost line-by-line. 
Consider it still a draft, though, until I do a more thorough check on it.
