# Extensions of H^k functions

This is a project I did for a seminar in Partial differential equations in fall, 2021/2022. I erroneously named the repository 'prolongations' initially. The correct English term seems to be 'extensions'.

I also found some blatant typos while translating to English that I need to fix.

This work is based on a soviet book excerpt sent to me by the lecturer. It includes no title and I do not remember asking him about it, so it is practically lost :|.
I would not upload the excerpt here to avoid copyright issues.
